# skivvy
A simple tool for testing JSON/HTTP APIs

Skivvy was developed in order to faciliate automated testing of web-APIs. If you've written an API that consumes or
produces JSON, skivvy makes it easy to create test-suites for these APIs.
You can think of skivvy as a more simple-minded cousin of cURL - it can't do many of the things cURL can - but the few things it can do it does well.

## try it out
#### running it through docker
This is the simplest and the recommended way to run skivvy.
```sh
docker run --rm hyrfilm/skivvy skivvy run --version
```
See below for a more useful example on how to run it using bind mounts.

#### installing it manually
* install through PIP
```sh
pip install skivvy
```
* download some examples
```sh
mkdir skivvy_examples
cd skivvy_examples
curl -OL https://github.com/hyrfilm/skivvy/raw/master/skivvy_examples.zip
tar xf skivvy_examples.zip
```
* run:
```sh
skivvy run cfg/example.json
```

#### running skivvy through docker (using bind mounts)
Assuming the current directory would contain your tests and that the root of that directory would contain a
configuration file `cfg.json` you could bind mount that directory and run skivvy like so:
```sh
docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target="/app" hyrfilm/skivvy skivvy run cfg.json
```

## what you can do with it

Let's say you've created an API for looking up definition of words. Calling the URL: ```http://example.com/words/api/skivvy``` would result in this being returned:

```json
{"word": "skivvy",
"results": [{
  "definition": "a female domestic servant who does all kinds of menial work",
  "type": "noun",
  "language": "English",
  "dialect": "British"
  }]
}
```
With skivvy you could easily create a testcase for this in a myraid of ways depending on what you would want to test:
#### checking the HTTP status-code
```json
{"url": "http://example.com/words/api/skivvy",
"status": 200}
```
#### checking fields
```json
{"url": "http://example.com/words/api/skivvy",
"response": {
   "results": [{
   "type": "noun",
   "language": "English"
   }]
}
```
#### checking the length of the results
```json
{"url": "http://example.com/words/api/skivvy",
"response": {
  "results": "$len 1"
  }
}
```
#### checking that the response contain some particular data
```json
{"url": "http://example.com/words/api/skivvy",
"response": "$contains servant who does all kinds of menial work"}
```

#### etc
Other things supported:
* test-suites incl using different environments (like staging / production)
* custom matcher syntax, for checking things like urls (```$valid_url```), approximations (```$~```), date-validation (```$date```), custom python-expression (```$expr```) and more
* ability to create extend the syntax to create own matchers easily
* all common http-verbs (get, put, post, delete)
* reading and writing http-headers
* file uploads
* dumping output from one testcase into a file and passing in parts of that data to other testcases
* ... and more! ;)

### Documentation
**NOTE:** The easiest way to gain understading of ways to use skivvy is to simply download the examples and _then_ look at the documentation.

All examples as zip: https://github.com/hyrfilm/skivvy/raw/master/skivvy_examples.zip
Or if you prefer to view them on github directly: https://github.com/hyrfilm/skivvy/tree/master/skivvy/examples

#### optional config settings
a skivvy testfile, can contain the following flags that changes how the tests is performed

#### mandatory config settings
* *tests* - directory where to look for tests (recursively)
* *ext* - file extension to look for (like ".json")
* *base_url* - base URL that will be prefixed for all tests

#### optional config settings
* *log_level* - a low value like 10, shows ALL logging, a value like 20 shows only info and more severe
* *colorize* - terminal colors for diffs (default is true)

#### mandatory settings for a testcase
* *url* - the URL that skivvy should send a HTTP request to 
* *base_url* - an base url (like "https://example.com") that will be prefixed for the URL
* *method* - what HTTP verb should be used (optional, defaults to GET)

#### optional settings for testcase
* *brace_expansion* - whether brace expansion should used for URLs containing \<variable> (these variables can be retrieved from a file in the path, or can be a file created using $write_file)
* *expected_status* - the expected HTTP status of the call
* *response* - the _expected_ response that should be checked against _actual_ response received from the API
* *data* - data should be sent in in POST or PUT request
* *json_encode_body* - setting this to false makes skivvy not json encode the body of a PUT or POST and instead sends it as form-data
* *headers* - headers to send into the request
* *content_type* - defaults to _"application/json"_
* *headers_to_write* - headers that should be retrieved from the HTTP response and dumped a file, for example: ````"write_headers": {"headers.json": ["Set-Cookie", "Cache-Control"]}, ````
* *headers_to_write* - specifies a file containing headers to be sent in the request, for example: ````"read_headers": "headers.json"````
* *match_subsets* - (boolean, default is false) - controls whether skivvy will allow to match a subset of a dict found in a list
* *match_falsiness* - (boolean, default is false) - controls whether skivvy will consider falsy values (such as null, and empty string, etc) as the same equivalent
* *upload* - see below for an example of uploading files
* auto_coerce - default is true, if the content of a file (read using [$read_file](#read_file) or [brace expansion](#brace-expansion)) can be interpreted as an integer it will be converted to that.

#### variables
Parts of a request may need to vary depending on context. Skivvy provides a number of ways to facilitate this:
* *If a response* contains a value you want to store, use
[$write_file](#$write_file)
* *If a response* contains a value you want to verify matches a value in a stored file, use [$read_file](#$read_file)
* If the *body of a request* should contain one or more values from a stored file, use [brace expansion](#brace-expansion)
* If the parts of the *url of a request* should contain one or more values from a stored file, use [brace expansion](#brace-expansion)
* If the *headers of a response* should be saved to a file, use $write_headers
* If the *headers of a request* should be read from a file, use $read_headers

#### brace expansion
```json
{
  "url": "http://example.com/<some>/<file>", 
  "a": "<foo>", 
  "b": "<bar>"
}
```

If you `brace_expansion` is to `true`. The value for `a` will be read from the file `foo` the value for `b`will be read from `bar`.
The first part of the path of the url will be read replaced with the contents of the file `some` and the second part by the contents of the file `file`. The file is expected to be in the path, otherwise no brace expansion will occur and the value is set as-is.
By default any value that can be interpreted as an integer will be coerced to an int. Disable this by setting `auto_coerce`to false.

#### file uploads
POSTs supports both file uploading & sending a post body as JSON. You can't have both (because that would result in conflicting HTTP-headers).
Uploads takes precedence, which means that if you have enabled file uploads for a testcase it will happily ignore the POST data you pass in.
Enabling a file upload would look like this:
```json
{
  "url": "http://example.com/some/path", 
  "upload": {"file": "./path/to/some/file"}
}
```
When seeing an upload field skivvy like above skivvy will try to open that file and pass it along in the field specified ("file"
in the example above). Currently only one upload is supported.
The file needs to either be a absolute path or relative to where skivvy is executing. If the file can't be found skivvy will
complain and mark the as failed.

### matchers

Skivvy's matcher-syntax is a simple, extensible notation that allows one greater expressiveness than vanilla-JSON would allow for.

For example, let's say you want to check that the field "email" containing a some characters followed by an @-sign,
some more characters followed by a dot and then some more characters (I don't recommend this as a way to check if an email is valid, which is quite hard!).
Then you could write:
```
"email": "$regexp (.+)@(.+)\.(.+)"
```
The format for all matchers are as following:
```
$matcher_name expected [parameter1 parameter2... parameterN].
```
The amount of parameters a particular matcher takes depends on what matcher you are using. Currently these matchers are supported out-of-the-box:

#### $valid_url
Matches any URL that returns a 200 status.
Example:
```
"some_page": "$valid_url"
```
would pass if `some_page` was `http://google.com`

#### $contains
Matches a string inside a field, good for finding nested information when you
don't care about the structure of what's returned.
Example:
```"foo": "$contains dude!" ```
would for example pass if `foo` was 
```json
{"movies": [{"title": "dude! where's my car?"}]}
```
#### $len
Matches the length on JSON-array.
Example:
```"foo": "$len 3" ```
would for example pass if `foo` was
```json
["a", "b", "c"]
```
#### $~
Matches an approximate value.
Example:
```
"foo": "$~ 100 threshold 0.1"
```
would match values between 90-110.
#### $write_file
Writes the value of a field to a file, which can then be passed to another test.
This is useful for scenarios where you want to save a field (like a database id) that
should be passed in to a subsequent test.
Example:
```
"foo": "$write_file dude.txt"
```
Would write the value of `foo` to the file `dude.txt`

#### $read_file
Reads the value of a file and sets a field to it (most useful in the body of a POST)
```json
...
"body": {
  "foo": "$read_file dude.txt"
}
```
Would read the contents of the file `dude.txt` and assign it to the field `foo`.
#### $regexp
Matches using a regular expression.
Example:
```"foo": "$regexp [a-z]+" ```
Would require `foo` to contain at least one occurence of the a or b... to z.
#### $expr
Dynamically evaluates the string as a python statement, on the data received if the statement evaluates to True it passes.
(Be careful with this one, don't use it on untrusted data etc :)
Example:
```
"foo": "$expr (int(actual)%3)==0"
``` 
Would try to convert the data in the field `foo` to an integer and see if it was
evenly dividable by 3. If so it would pass, otherwise fail.
