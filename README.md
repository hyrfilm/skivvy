# skivvy
A simple tool for testing JSON/HTTP APIs

Skivvy was developed in order to faciliate automated testing of web-APIs. If you've written an API that consumes or
produces JSON, you can probably test it with Skivvy more easily than most other tools.
You can think of skivvy as a more simple-minded cousin of cURL - it can't do many of the things cURL can or nearly as
well, but the thing it does it does well.
